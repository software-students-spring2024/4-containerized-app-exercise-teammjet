# Campus Exchange Auto-Labeler
The Campus Exchange Auto-Labeler is an extension of our group's project for exercise 2, which allows college students to trade items on a platform shared by other college students. Users simply upload a photo of the item they wish to trade, and the Auto-Labeler effortlessly generates a string description of the item which can be used to aid purchasing decisions on Campus Exchange (TM).

- **Web App:** Users upload pictures of items and the app returns a categorized label for each item
- **Machine Learning Client:** Alexnet library for labeling photos
- **Database:** For each item, a MongoDB database stores photo and an string representation of its respective category generated by machine learning algorithm
